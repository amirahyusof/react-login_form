# Project
Login Form
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Description
- To get more understanding in useState function, I come up with this project to practice
- The problem that I face during this practice is to put condition for an error and use the 'value' of data that have been enter by user.
- I can overcome the problem by doing some reading and search through website
